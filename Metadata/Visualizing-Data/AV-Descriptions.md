## A/V Descriptions

_Below are descriptions for audio-visual clips requested by the curators for the upcoming exhibition on Visualizing Data. Text is not yet finalized and is subject to further editing._

#### Clip 1 | The Life of Flannery O’ Connor (Suellen Stringer-Hye)
* Description: When Flannery O'Connor, suffering from lupus, retired  to her ancestral farm in Milledgville Georgia, in 1951, she devoted herself to raising peacocks and other exotic birds as well as to writing. Peacocks can be found in many of her stories and essays.  "I intend to stand firm and let the peacocks multiply, for I am sure that, in the end, the last word will be theirs." Peacocks endure as emblems of the life and spirit of Flannery O'Connor and her art.

#### Clip 2 | Flannery O’Connor at Vanderbilt (Suellen Stringer-Hye)
* Description: In 1955 Flannery O'Connor began a correspondence with Brainard and Francis Cheney. Brainard was a fellow Southern writer and "Fanny" was a librarian at Vanderbilt University. On one of her several trips to Nashville to visit the Cheney's, Flannery read to an appreciative audience her short story, “A Good Man is Hard to Find”. Vanderbilt University,  April 1959.

#### Clip 3 | Minecraft SEC Football Stadiums Tour 1: Vanderbilt Stadium! (Cliff Anderson)
* Description: The video game Minecraft may be compared to a 21st century Lego kit. Players in create worlds unbound by the ordinary laws of physics. In many cases, they also recreate structures in the physical world. In this instance, a Minecraft user, "plom6," has recreated the Vanderbilt University Stadium inside the game world of Minecraft.

#### Clip 4 | Bessie Smith's "Backwater Blues" (Lindsey Fox)
* Description: In December of 1926, Nashville and the Cumberland River, was hit with a major flooding event.  In response to the devastation caused by the flooding, Bessie Smith sang a song.  The song, called Backwater Blues, describes the five days of rain that subsequently inundated the Music City.

#### Clip 5 | "O, Cumberland River" (Lindsey Fox)
* Description: Old Crow Medicine Show wrote a song about the Cumberland River.  The song describes the wild rainstorms and subsequent flooding that plague the Cumberland River.  Major flooding events have happened in the 1920's, 1930's, 1970's, and the 2000's.  The lyrics talk about the Cumberland flowing through a guitar town- Nashville.

#### Clip 6 | Caruso Sings _Vesti La Giubba_ from _Il Pagliacci_ (Mary Anne Caton and Carla Beals)
* Description: This video features the famous Italian tenor, Enrico Caruso. The clip from the silent film My Cousin (1918) features Caruso in his signature role – Canino in Leoncavallo's Il Pagliacci. The aria seen here,“Vesti la Giubba,” comes at the end of Act I. Canino has just discovered that his beloved wife has been unfaithful but he must prepare to perform or “put on the costume” and continue the show. Caruso first played the role in Milan in 1897, and recorded it in 1907. 

#### Clip 7 | Touch the Universe
* Description: The authors of a Braille book of Hubble images talk about the genesis of the idea, the process of its creation, and testing. This is an example of the ultimate in visualizing.

#### Clip 8 | Fomalhaut b : Zombie Exoplanet
* Description: In 2008 an exoplanet was detected orbiting the star Fomalhaut.  In 2012 other astronomers questioned the existence of the planet because they could not detect its heat. Since then, earlier data has been reanalyzed and confirms the existence of a much smaller exoplanet.

#### Clip 9 | Earth’s Most Powerful Natural Particle Accelerator
* Description: We have known that powerful thunderstorms can produce terrestrial gamma-ray flashes, or TGFs. Since Fermi studies helped uncover lightning-like radio signals emitted by TGFs, this made it possible to use ground-based lightning location networks to pin down storms producing the flashes, opening the door to a deeper understanding of the meteorology powering these extreme events.

#### Clip 10 | Singing Stars
* Description: The Kepler space telescope catches the flickering of light on stars. The upwelling of hot gas and the descending of cooling gasses create hot and cold spots that flicker.  This flickering is then turned into sound and the sounds of these stars represent variations in its brightness. Tonal variations come from “sunspots” as the star spins.  The hiss is from granulation at the surface of the star and gives us information about the size of the star.
